# ladgate
Modular IRC Bot

The ladgate core module connects to an IRC server to await instructions.
When invited into a channel, ladgate will join and then respond to admin CONNECT requests.

Once ladgate is connected to a server, ladgate listens and relays back to the channel any messages or invites etc that ladgate recieves.
